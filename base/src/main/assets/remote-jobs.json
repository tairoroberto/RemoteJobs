    "description": "#### About SurveyMonkey\r\n\r\nFounded in 1999, SurveyMonkey is the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading platform for turning people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voices and opinions into actionable data \u00e2\u0080\u0094 People Powered Data. Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with customers, employees, or a target market, SurveyMonkey helps curious individuals and companies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including 99% of the Fortune 500 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have conversations at scale with the people who matter most. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s People Powered Data that allows them to understand not only \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u009d is happening, but \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d SurveyMonkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 700+ employees throughout North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are dedicated to powering the curious.\r\n\r\n#### About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions\r\n\r\nSurveyMonkey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform is used for a myriad of purposes across a broad spectrum of industries. That leaves ample opportunity to build targeted products that solve a specific problem. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where our team comes in. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re responsible for building standalone solutions that address the needs of businesses.\r\n\r\nSo far, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built three:\r\n\r\n- [SurveyMonkey CX](https:\/\/cx.surveymonkey.com\/) - Measure and improve customer satisfaction\r\n- [SurveyMonkey Engage](https:\/\/engage.surveymonkey.com\/) - Understand and foster employee engagement\r\n- [TechValidate](https:\/\/www.techvalidate.com\/) - Publish 3rd-party verified customer proof \r\n\r\nWe operate each product as a small startup within the larger SurveyMonkey organization. This affords us flexibility to quickly try new ideas, but with the resources of larger company. Our goal is to build high growth, profitable businesses that leverage the enormous user base of SurveyMonkey.\r\n\r\n#### The Team\r\n\r\nOur small team is responsible for building products from soup to nuts. We wear many hats and span both the technical stack and departments. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the opportunity to work alongside colleagues who have successfully launched and sold numerous products.\r\n\r\nMost of us choose to focus on one solution at a time. We feel this allows us to fully embrace and understand our customer needs and develop a deep technical understanding of the problem domain. However, we are also committed to sharing our work - not just with each other, but via open source contributions.\r\n\r\n#### Who We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Looking For\r\n\r\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a mid-level or senior developer with a deep understanding of all aspects of the web application stack. You should care about the quality of your code, user experience, and how your choices impact the business as a whole. You need to be able to evaluate tradeoffs and make decisions.\r\n\r\nOur team has been building Rails applications for over ten years. That experience has solidified our belief that the default Rails stack is the single best way to build web applications.  While we shy away from complexity (like front end frameworks), we are quick to embrace tools that give us leverage (ActionCable, Turbolinks) or improve developer happiness (ES6, Webpacker).\r\n\r\nIf this mindset speaks to you, please include a cover letter along with your resume to introduce yourself. Our team puts a lot of stock in written communication. Plus, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d appreciate a sense of your personality.\r\n\r\n#### Why Work Here?\r\n\r\nWe are a remote team. As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific time zone by at least four hours, where you live and work is up to you. You will be asked to travel a few times a year for a full team meeting. We use this time not only for larger planning discussions, but also for a little social interaction. In the past year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone bowling in Phoenix and made sushi in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nWe are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. If you consider yourself to be a manager of one, this role is a great fit.\r\n\r\nWe offer competitive salaries, medical\/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and equity compensation.",

Our duties include configuration management with Chef, wrestling with tricky Rails bugs, big-data cluster wrangling with Hadoop, mitigating the logo-branded vulnerability du jour, wearing a DBA hat to the InnoDB rodeo, bomb-proofing the mad science lab that is our codebase and, very occasionally, sweeping up the pieces when everything blows up. (We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let that last happen often.)\r\n\r\nWe work on almost every part of our application stack, from the servers and storage through the databases and caches to the application itself. We write code ourselves, including deep in the guts of our product, and developers also come to us for technical guidance. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not simply operate the systems, but be part of the system-building process from the start. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all seen the \u00e2\u0080\u009cworked in dev, ops problem now\u00e2\u0080\u009d meme and reject that world-view.\r\n\r\nWe believe in continuously improving our skills and codebase, work\/life balance, and doing things right over doing them fast. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for engineers who share these views and are interested in contributing their knowledge, skills, and sound technical judgement to a growing engineering organization. In return, we offer interesting problems, plenty of opportunity to influence key technical decisions, and the chance to top the office pinball high score table.\r\n\r\n**Our tools and technologies**\r\n\r\n- Linux (primarily CentOS)\r\n- Ruby (our core codebase is Rails), but with projects in Go and Scala too\r\n- Chef\r\n- MySQL (Percona), HBase and Elasticsearch\r\n- Hadoop, Hive and Spark, all fed via Kafka\r\n- Nagios, Graphite and Grafana\r\n- Nginx, HAProxy and Varnish, to serve our content to the wider world\r\n\r\nHaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked with precisely the same set of technologies we use, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used something broadly similar? No problem! We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just as happy to talk FreeBSD or commiserate with your AIX and pains as we are to chat about CentOS.\r\n\r\n#### About the Role\r\n\r\n**You will**\r\n\r\n- Develop, operate, and troubleshoot the systems that keep Scribd alive and fast\r\n- Build, maintain and extend our automation. Quelling robot uprisings strictly optional\r\n- Pioneer, evaluate, and deploy new technologies for the entire engineering organization\r\n- Work in partnership with your peers on the product engineering teams\r\n- Be part of an on-call rotation with other members of the DevOps team\r\n- Work independently within a team environment to prioritize workload\r\n\r\n**About you**\r\n\r\n- Local candidates are great, but the DevOps team is open to remote candidates and those looking relocate\r\n- 3-5+ years professional experience in an Engineering, Technical Operations, or DevOps role\r\n- Professional experience with at least part of our tech stack, but not necessarily every piece\r\n\r\n#### Why we work here\r\n\r\n- 100% employer covered Medical\/Dental\/Vision for regular, full time employees\r\n- We have a small budget for our employees to attend conferences, classes, and other events\r\n- We have a lot of trust with very little bureaucracy\r\n- Company events that include monthly happy hours and offsites (past events include Safari West, Stinson Beach, ski trips, etc.)\r\n- In the meantime, check out our office and meet some of the team on [The Muse](https:\/\/www.themuse.com\/companies\/scribd)!\r\n\r\n_Scribd values diversity, and we make all hiring and employment decisions based on merit, qualifications, competence, talent, and contribution, not who you are by choice or circumstance. \r\nWe value the people who make Scribd a great place to work and strive to create an environment where your work is supported and personhood respected._",

    "description": "#### WHO WE ARE\r\n\r\nHeetch is a ride-sharing app with a simple mission: we want people to enjoy going out. Every night and day, our drivers are doing everything to make your ride unforgettable and friendly! We are focusing on young people expectations and compete with many actors on this segment.\r\n\r\nThe service has been launched in Paris in September, 2013 and is growing very fast since then, with thousands of rides every night in France, Italy, Sweden, Belgium and Morocco.\r\nWith more than 1 million users in Europe, we are proud to be one of the French fastest growing startup!\r\n\r\nSimply put, we aim at offering the most playful ridesharing experience for party-goers, and the most satisfying night out for drivers. Our app is the centerpiece of the whole service, where drivers are able to get ride requests, where passengers are able to request rides, and where everyone is able to get in touch with us directly at anytime.\r\n\r\nWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see our users open up Heetch just because we can get them from point A to point B, we want them to open the app because they feel like it was specifically built for them. We want to build upon our core service everything that would make every ride enjoyable. Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helping them put the music passengers want to listen to, help drivers find the right spots to go to and the right ride, give recommandations about places passengers would want to go, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all open for anyone to suggest.\r\n\r\n#### MOBILE AT HEETCH\r\n\r\nOur app is one of the few mobile apps that run in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.\r\n\r\nNetwork and GPS management: we need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, provide as accurate as possible GPS localisation for the pricing and tracking.\r\n\r\nUI & UX: Ride sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for a great user experience.\r\n\r\nOne way data flow and functional pattern: we are passionate about software architecture. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to push forward what doing mobile programming means and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.\r\n\r\n#### WHAT YOU\u00e2\u0080\u0099LL DO\r\n\r\n- Build new exciting features.\r\n- Solve challenging real-time synchronization problems.\r\n- Build a robust & modern in-house framework, that will serve our app for next 4 years.\r\n- Practise continuous refactoring and unit testing to constantly improve the codebase.\r\n- Create custom UI components (with Playground Driven Development).\r\n- Work on our great shiny redesign of the app.\r\n- Experimenting with various concepts (Coordinators\/Flows, ReSwift).\r\n\r\n#### REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n- Great oral and written communication skills.\r\n- Speaking both French AND English is mandatory.\r\n- At least 3-4 years of experience with both Objective C and Swift in production environments.\r\n- Strong mobile development culture.\r\n- You know how to make integration testing less painful (XCTests, FBSnapshots).\r\n- Strong understanding of the iOS SDK (UIKit, MapKit).\r\n- Ability to thrive in a startup environment.\r\n\r\nBonus Points\r\n\r\n- Contributions to open source projects.\r\n- Experience with RxSwift.\r\n\r\n#### PERKS\r\n\r\n- Stocks.\r\n- Paid conference attendance\/travel.\r\n- Heetch credits.\r\n- A Spotify subscription.\r\n- Medical care\r\n- Code retreats and company retreats.\r\n- Travel budget (visit your remote coworkers and our offices).\r\n\r\n#### OUR ENGINEERING VALUES\r\n\r\n- Move smart: we are data driven, and employ tools and best practices to ship code quickly and safely (continuous integration, code review, automated testing, etc).\r\n- Distribute knowledge: we want to scale our engineering team to a point where our contributions do not stop at the company code base. We believe in the Open Source culture and communication with the outside world.\r\n- Leave code better than you found it: because we constantly raise the bar.\r\n- Unity makes strength: moving people from A to B is not as easy as it sounds but, we always keep calm and support each other.\r\n- Always improve: we value personal progress and want you to look back proudly on what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done.",

And in this front-end centric role engineering role, you will directly help us to build web and mobile interfaces that thousands of users will interact with on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nOn the front-end side, we mostly use React and Redux in our front-end stack, but that is only the start of what we need to build our next-gen product. Strong mobile development using React Native and a future GraphQL implementation are now on the roadmap and we are looking for the right candidate who is eager to apply their thoughts, ideas, and sound software engineering practices to help us get there.\r\n\r\n**The Job**\r\n\r\n- Architect, build, and ship the components necessary to make our apps web and mobile ready.\r\n- Collaborate with our product and design teams to create the functional implementation and vision of the product.\r\n- Keep us current with the best front-end development architectural patterns so we can deliver the best possible experience to our users.\r\n- Implement features that not only work well but are created with future maintenance in mind.\r\n\r\n**Job Requirements**\r\n\r\n- Deep experience with modern Javascript tools and frameworks. We use ES6, React, Redux, and React Native. At least 2 to 3 years of production experience with these tools is highly preferred.\r\n- Past experience with WebSockets and real-time UI patterns\r\n- Expertise in JavaScript language fundamentals\r\n- The ability and curiosity for learning new methodologies, languages, and more \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we love to experiment!\r\n\r\n**We want to talk to you if you are:**\r\n\r\n- Self-motivated. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be micromanaged or have your hand held. You are eager to take on new challenges and we will support you the entire way.\r\n- A learner. You love learning new languages and methodologies. And if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know something, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a roadblock \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you seek answers wherever you can find them, and aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afraid to ask others for help.\r\n- Gets stuff done. You enjoy iterating step by step on a product so features get into the hands of our users as quickly as possible.

    "description": "We've built a microservice architecture that allows us to rapidly scale to accommodate ever-increasing user needs. Your job is to build new services that enhance the customer experience or our internal tooling while maintaining our standards of performance and robustness.\r\n\r\nYou'll collaborate closely with our CEO, CTO, DevOps, and Front End engineers to build across our tech stack and deliver best-in-class insurance technology.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our engineers, you will test, QA, deploy, and maintain your own code within our continuous integration framework. That means pushing a change to production on your first day, and continuing to improve our services from then on. As you learn, you'll be able to keep the team informed on emerging best practices, and champion ideas you believe in.\r\n\r\n***We pay competitive salaries. We're serious about remote work and flexible hours. Equity and benefits included. All negotiable.***\r\n\r\n#### REQUIREMENTS\r\n- Experience building and maintaining distributed systems\r\n- Fundamentals in data structures, algorithm design, problem solving, and complexity analysis\r\n- Demonstrated debugging and troubleshooting skills\r\n- Advanced knowledge of C++ or Java\r\n- Experience with Git or another distributed version control system\r\n\r\n#### IDEAL CANDIDATE\r\n- 5+ years of engineering experience\r\n- Excited to work in a rigorous CI environment that favors robust, performant code vs. quick hacks\r\n- Contributions to open source projects\r\n- Advanced knowledge of JavaScript\r\n- Proficient with Git\/Github and Jenkins \r\n- Deeply motivated to build things that make a real difference to everyday lives\r\n\r\n#### Working at Hugo\r\nWhether you're an engineer, a designer, or an adjuster, every position at Hugo requires three things: estimating how much work a given task will take, when you will be finished with it, and what it means for our members. These three things let us work flexibly because we are consistently improving our forecasting ability and staying motivated to deliver for our members. \r\n\r\nWhat does that mean for the day-to-day? It means a single team check-in at 9AM PT where you discuss your tasks for the day and any help you will need. Then, you're free to complete that task at your own pace and on your own schedule. We do a weekly retrospective to assess team performance, and a bi-weekly sprint planner. \r\n\r\nEvery team seeks to get something out into the wild every day - whether it's a paper prototype or a full deployment to production.\r\n\r\nWe take your personal development seriously - the better you are, the better we can deliver for our members and community. As part of your onboarding, we'll discuss your development goals and how we can contribute. That includes everything from blog posts to conferences and sponsored meet-ups. \r\n\r\nHugo is an EEO employer that actively pursues and hires a diverse workforce, and will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records. Our salaries, perks, and benefits are all negotiable. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t judge people based on schools or degrees.\r\n\r\n#### Our application process\r\nOur goal is to take as little of your time as possible - and be transparent throughout.\r\n\r\nEvery candidate answers 3 relevant entry-level questions. Technical and design hires submit 2 portfolio pieces. Please do not send a resume or \"about me\".\r\n\r\nIf things work out, we will invite you to a 30 minute call where we will discuss your prior experience and future goals, and roles you've enjoyed or found frustrating. \r\n\r\nIf that call goes well, we will invite you to a 30 minute call to discuss your area of expertise and work habits.\r\n\r\nFrom there, you will be provided an area-specific problem to solve in your own time (with as much or as little support from us as desired), followed by a two-on-one review and debrief call.

Some examples of the work you'll be doing include the following:\n\n* Continually improving our fetching code, which grabs information about millions of properties throughout each day\n* Integrating against a new REST api to give our customers even more info about a house\n* Making our mobile website a more pleasant experience\n* Rewriting a SQL query to be 100x faster\n\nYou'll have both the opportunity and the independence to tackle all kinds of challenges: some days you'll work on refactoring a legacy part of the app to make it do something new, and on others, you'll build a brand new, greenfield feature.\n\nAbout You:\n\nYou care about both building and maintaining a clean, readable, well tested codebase. We're looking for someone with Ruby experience. We mostly work with Ruby, Rails, Postgres, React, and SCSS. We don't require you to know all of these, but you should be experienced in Ruby, comfortable with Rails, and eager to learn new technologies. You communicate well and collaborate with the whole team, be it to work through tough code problems or clarify product specifications.\n\nAbout Us\n\n* We're a small team focused on opening up the old school real estate world.\n* Our goal is to build the best place for people to browse, shop for, and buy homes.\n* We employ an iterative approach to building products and deploy multiple times a day.\n* We have a big vision.\n* We believe in hiring smart people and giving them the support and flexibility to succeed.\n* If you work locally, you'll be in a relaxed and fun office in the Belltown neighborhood.\n\nWe're looking to hire the best people wherever they are in the world. If you don't want to relocate to beautiful Seattle, you should be awesome at working from home and available to join our daily standup at 10am Pacific. Some developers live in Seattle and come into the Estately office, but the majority live and work remotely, including several who live outside of the United States. We've had remote developers since 2011, and are seasoned veterans of working with a distributed team, across multiple time zones.\n\nOur Hiring Process\n\nWe believe in collaborative interviews where we work with you to solve realistic problems. We interview for practical skills in a one-on-one setting, and strive to use your preferred editor and tools whenever possible. Great candidates don't usually write code on white boards, or implement basic data structures from scratch, so we won't ask you to do that. We want our recruiting process to be transparent to you. It roughly consists of the following steps:\n\n* An initial call between you and a member of our team: We'll tell you more about the work that you'd be doing, and why we think Estately is a great place to work. You'll have the opportunity to ask us lots of questions, too. We'll ask you about your experience and some technical questions, mostly to get a feel for where you're at as we move forward with the process.\n\n* Individual Exercise: We have a few practical challenges to assess technical knowledge. Over the course of a few hours, you'll be fixing a bug in our app (that we've previously fixed), so we can see how you approach solving a realistic problem.\n\n* Pairing on a Few Potential Features: During the pairing exercises you'll pair with one of our developers to implement an (existing) feature in the app. This will take a couple hours or so, and will mostly consist of discussion about approach, with some coding in the midst of it.\n\n* Discussion with representatives from our Product and Design teams: As a small team, all of our developers work very closely with product and design. These short sessions will give you a chance to meet and speak with the product and design folks that you would be working with on a regular basis.\n\nDiversity\n\nEstately seeks to increase the ratio of women and underrepresented minorities in software engineering and development, we encourage women and people from underrepresented groups to apply for this position.\n\nEstately is striving to be a diverse team, made of and built by people with different backgrounds and lifestyles. We don't discriminate based on race, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, age, religion, color, or any other group.\n\nApply Now!: http:\/\/estately.applytojob.com\/apply\/fscQ2yAhnm\/Ruby-Full-Stack-Developer?source=Remoteok",

We do code reviews, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t merge into mainstream any substantial code without being reviewed and approved.\r\n\r\nFor all the above reasons we are a teal organization. What does it mean?\r\n\r\nEveryone at Cycloid meets once every quarter at our headquarter in France to define collectively the strategy\/road map\/features for the coming quarter. Then, everyone defines their own agenda and priorities that to achieve his own goal.\r\n\r\nWe are fully transparent on revenues, salaries and believe that everybody should have the same variable plan.\r\n\r\nWe have signed millions since our creation in April 2015, we are 100% self-funded and have neither external investors nor bank credits.\r\n\r\nWe take the time that we need to build useful products and provide great services.\r\n\r\n#### SKILLS\r\n\r\nYou are a passionate software engineer, which is the most important, with several years of experience crafting software, would be better, and with:\r\n\r\n- at least one year of experience in web frontend development and with a good understanding of the architecture of the web applications, Javascript and DOM API. Our current development is with VueJS, but we believe that if you understand the web and you have experience developing web applications, you should be able familiar with it without any problem in a few weeks.\r\n- broad experience in back-end development and HTTP APIs. Preferably, you have some experience with Go or it doesn't look weird to you, knowledge of distributed systems and simplicity and familiar with the UNIX philosophy.\r\n\r\nWe are splitting the work 50% Frontend 50% Backend to break the monotony.\r\n\r\nBut what is really important is that we are looking for more than just a developer.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for a person who can build with us new features, can bring some new ideas on what could be a great DevOps dashboard\/pipeline to simplify the work of users. If you don't have any ideas, it will be a challenge because we don't have a product manager and we are trying to work without it due to our culture. We want to empower people.\r\n\r\nYou are, of course, a team player and know how to work in remote even if you can work at Cycloid office in Paris if you are in Paris. You can decide to work on remote wherever you are located but all the organization is in an asynchronous manner, keeping a good team culture through Slack and conference meetings.\r\n\r\nYou have adequate written and oral communication skills in English, any others languages would be a plus.\r\n\r\n_Cycloid is committed to having equality between women and men. In that way, we strongly encourage women's application._\r\n\r\n__What do we expect that you send to us?__\r\n\r\nYour CV or a LinkedIn profile or a personal website where we can know more about your professional experience. If you have relevant public open source contributions, then you have a huge plus; your contributions to open source projects, created by you or by others, are very important for us, however because you may have quite a few contributions, send us a selection of them, linking the repositories of the projects, the relevant issues and pull\/merge requests that you have contributed implementing, reporting, commenting and\/or reviewing.",

We connect applications, wherever they are hosted, to independent cloud services made by developers who care.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for an experienced, collaborative front-end engineer to inspire us, teach us, and bring our React architecture and coding forward.\r\n\r\nOur partially distributed engineering team is fun-loving, knowledgeable, and extremely productive. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re organized to let you explore and grow a variety of skills and capabilities, with many opportunities to make a significant impact. Many of us have strong ties to the open-source world, and have experience building tools at companies like Heroku, Red Hat, and Canonical.\r\n\r\nWe value diversity and supporting a distributed culture. Gender diversity is currently about one quarter. About half of the company work outside of the home Halifax, Canada office, including the product and engineering leaders.\r\n\r\n##### What you'll do\r\n#### Responsibilities\r\n\r\n* Help lead a friendly, supportive engineering culture that encourages you and the entire company to improve as engineers, teams, and people.\r\n* Be a model and mentor for building well-architected, performant, well-tested, and understandable code.\r\n* Prevent and manage technical debt. Help us find the right corners to cut for speed, and the right problems to invest in for maintainability.\r\n* Be passionate about our mission, and help us imagine Manifold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future. Work closely with design and product in short design-first iteration.\r\n* Be curious. Learn, practice, share, and improve our knowledge and best practices in technologies, security, engineering, design and collaboration.\r\n\r\n##### What you'll need\r\n#### Qualifications\r\n\r\n* Strong communication skills with a team centric approach to discussion and decision making. Empathy and respect for others.\r\n* Experience deploying and operating server-side code that could have used a service like Manifold.\r\n* Expertise in Javascript, REST APIs, React and managing state. Knowledge of Redux, Redux-Saga, GraphQL, and other parts of the React ecosystem is also very valuable.\r\n* Full command of Git, GitHub, the terminal, continuous deployment and integration, and other modern fundamentals.\r\n* Experience working in a distributed team is very nice to have.\r\n* Our backend and CLI are written in Go; Go experience is nice to have.\r\n\r\n##### We're looking for\r\n#### Core Skills\r\n\r\n* Guidance and mentorship\r\n* JavaScript\r\n* Technical Leadership\r\n* React\r\n\r\n##### A little bit about us\r\n#### Manifold\r\n\r\nAt Manifold, we help developers discover and use innovative tools and technologies; so you can focus on building, not managing, your applications. Each new cloud service we use today introduces complexity in the form of another bill, account to manage, credential to secure, and code to deploy.\r\n\r\nManifold allows you to build and offer cloud services to developers without having to worry about billing, identity, and credential distribution (An example of one such service: [JawsDB](https:\/\/www.jawsdb.com\/)).\r\n\r\nWe're a small, remote-friendly venture-backed company based in Halifax, Canada with teams in Toronto and San Francisco. With a shared passion for making developers lives easier and our backgrounds reflect that, having worked at the likes of Red Hat, Heroku, and Salesforce.\r\n\r\n##### Are you interested?\r\n#### Work With Us\r\n\r\nWe believe in having people work from where they are most productive. If that happens to be in our offices in Halifax, Canada, or in San Francisco, welcome! We'd love to have you. If you are remote, you are also welcome! We strongly prefer candidates who are in a timezone roughly within 4 hours of the Eastern time zone.\r\n\r\nWe offer competitive compensation, equity opportunities, and excellent health care options, with additional perks such as a yearly professional development allowance.",

Due to the remote nature of this company, communication through chat, email, video conferencing, and ticket tracking systems is key.\n\nThis job consists of assisting the business by getting estimates for projects\/tasks, tracking\/communicating timelines and statuses, reporting, and risk management. Communication throughout the full lifecycle of projects is key, so understanding where something is at, how much time is left, any complexities that have come up, who is working on it, etc is extremely important. We use tools like Jira, Confluence, Upwork, and Lucidcharts for tracking and communication, so projects will be managed there. ",

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the lookout for a confident and ambitious Devops \/ Sysadmin to join our fast growing startup to help us automate our development processes and build our first SaaS product.\n\nWe do things a little differently, basing all our solutions on open source products, offer a great work-life balance with flexible working hours and a real team mentality.\n\nOur work covers web design, app development and branding for Charities and non-profit organisations across the country. Our clients include Charities such as Wikimedia and Farm Africa, art galleries such as the Photographers Gallery and Craft Central but also companies, trade associations and government bodies. We mainly work on the Drupal platform, but someone with a wide range of interests would be favourable.\n\nWe are looking for someone to join the team with the vision to help us automate our infrastructure so that everything runs like clockwork. That will involve:\n\n- Automating tasks such as security and deployment releases, site updates and server maintenance using tools such as Jenkins, Chef, Puppet, Ansible etc\n- Maintaining and developing our Docker containers for developer environments and testing environments\n- Be a key architect in helping us to develop a robust SaaS platform for a really significant Drupal project for the not for profit sector that we are currently working on.\n- Integrating with Slack\/Hipchat\/Stride and developing an inhouse Hubot (or similar).\n- Develop command line tools to simplify developer tasks such as cloning client sites to local environments.\n- There will also be the opportunity to get involved with data migration, data integration, database tuning and management and the ideal candidate would have existing MySQL (or similar) experience.\n\nIf you live and breath Linux and love reconfiguring Web servers for the LEMP\/LAMP stack until they are as secure as a rock but would also enjoy the challenge of developing a new SaaS platform on AWS then we would love to hear from you.\n\n**Skills and requirements**\n\nKey skills we are looking for are:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Excellent Linux administration skills.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 PHP Web server experience (NGINX preferable, Apache useful).\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Some DB admin experience (Mysql or equivalent).\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Experience with cloud technologies AWS\/Open stack.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Previous experience with CI\/DevOps tools platforms (i.e. Jenkins, Chef, Puppet, Ansible).\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Good Git skills (comfortable preparing release branches).\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Previous PHP deployment automation desirable.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Some experience\/Knowledge in monitoring tools.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Strong collaboration, written and verbal skills.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Love creating awesome documentation!\n\nWhat were looking for is someone who can grasp concepts quickly, has great attention to detail, and most importantly loves a tech challenge. In short, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a team of self confessed geeks who love tinkering and tweaking until something is just right and are looking for someone who thinks and acts like us.\n\n**Location**\n\nAt Compucorp we are a distributed team and we welcome people to join us from all around the world, however as a UK based Company some overlap with UK hours will be required. By default you should assume that your working hours would be +\/- 3h max from GMT start times of 9.00AM UK start time. There is some flexibility in this but please be aware that staff members starting outside of these hours are rare and as such if you would expect these hours to be an issue for you then we would not suggest that you apply. \n\nFor the Devops role, due to EU data protection requirements, the team member must be from either an EEA country or a country that the EU considers to have adequate level of data protection.

    "description": "<p>Currently we're the market for two senior engineers. &nbsp;We develop a very comprehensive healthcare web-application that runs all aspects of a medical practice (from GP practices up to large hospitals groups). Our application includes:<\/p><br \/><ul><br \/><li>Patient medical record system<\/li><br \/><li>Comprehensive consultation suite<\/li><br \/><li>Document management<\/li><br \/><li>Scheduling<\/li><br \/><li>Accounting<\/li><br \/><li>Email<\/li><br \/><li>Social network<\/li><br \/><li>Task management<\/li><br \/><li>Referral management<\/li><br \/><li>Reporting and query system for analytics<\/li><br \/><li>Clinical text analysis using NLP<\/li><br \/><li>Collaboration system<\/li><br \/><li>Practice networking<\/li><br \/><li>Patient portal<\/li><br \/><li>Occupational health portal<\/li><br \/><li>PACS system (MRI\/X-ray\/Ultrasound)<\/li><br \/><li>And much more...<\/li><br \/><\/ul><br \/><p>We have a very relaxed working environment that is more akin to a start-up than a company that's been running for 12 years. We have a team of 8 developers who are very capable and committed (only one developer has left in the 12 years, and that was because he'd been offered a PhD placement). There are no office politics or any of that nonsense, it's a very collaborative environment. We try to keep quite a&nbsp;<em>flat<\/em>&nbsp;structure where we&nbsp;expect my developers to take responsibility for dealing with everything in their purview (with the CTO there as adviser if needed). This has allowed us to keep the team small and efficient.<\/p><br \/><p>Obviously with web-application development there's a reasonable amount of CRUD work, that's a given. But we have also developed interesting in-house tech of our own (distributed databases for document storage, natural language processing for clinical text parsing, UI frameworks, distributed config systems with PAXOS, language-ext, and echo-process, to name a few). We run on our own machines in high-security data-centres rather than on AWS\/Azure, and so we have also developed our own in-house solutions for deployment, etc.<\/p><br \/><p>The people we need are 'self starters' and are happy to work on any part of the stack, from UI, to back-end, to data-centre automation, services etc. &nbsp;<strong>You must be prepared to develop code using the functional paradigm -&nbsp;this is super important, if you think Martin Fowler is a god, please don't apply. <\/strong><\/p><br \/><p>We need creatively minded individuals who can solve unique problems; not just with code problems, but in improving healthcare too. Healthcare professionals are often not very tech-savvy, and are therefore either scared or incapable of communicating with tech-people. So I need programmers than can hear a real world problem and think creatively and with empathy for the end user.<\/p><br \/><p>You should have significant C# and web-development experience (the web experience doesn't have to be with .NET, we use ASP.NET for our 'transport' mechanism only - we don't use any of the MS frameworks (other than the .NET BCL) -- they change so often, and when we started writing the app 12 years ago they were mostly awful). F# experience is useful but not essential. If you don't have F# experience, you will be expected to learn it and use it: we've been writing some of our satellite components in F#, and we want to use it more (the core application is C#, so that will give you time to get up to speed anyway).<\/p><br \/><p>If you know [Language-Ext](https:\/\/github.com\/louthy\/language-ext\/) (and understand why it exists) then that will help, as we use it throughout the application to bring robustness to our system. SQL Server is our primary database solution, so experience with that is essential - but we also use Postgres. If you have any Postgres experience that would be valuable.<\/p><br \/><p>We don't care about what degree you have (or don't have), but we do want to see experience and a passion for what you do. Github projects are the incredibly&nbsp;helpful for that. Written and spoken English must be good. And unfortunately until we know what is happening with Brexit: resident in the UK.<\/p><br \/><p>We offer a very attractive salary, employee profit sharing, and a relaxed working environment - working on proper technological solutions. You will not be forced\/expected to work long hours as so often happens in software (in fact we actively discourage it). Remote working is also an option, most of the devs work remotely (but this must be after an initial in-office trial period of 3 months). &nbsp;Remote workers are expected to visit the office at least once per-month for the development team meeting, which is where the developers all get together to talk about interesting things (not always work related).<\/p><br \/><p><strong>No recruitment agencies \/ soliciting<\/strong><\/p><br \/><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements<\/strong><\/p><br \/><p>Significant experience in C# and evidence of a varied career in software development<\/p><br \/><p>Nice to have F# or any functional language experience<\/p><br \/><p>A willingness to use the functional language paradigm rather than OO<\/p><br \/><p>SQL Server \/ any relational database experience<\/p><br \/><p>Web application development experience<\/p><br \/><p>Outside interests that convey that you're a human being and not a robot!<\/p>",

Everybody says that sort of thing, but we really mean it. We're looking for a software engineering dynamo with form and character who can help us modify and extend an Ethereum fork without making a mess.\n\nWorking on this project will require an expert knowledge of the Ethereum codebase (and specifically geth) and the inner workings of the EVM, a solid understanding of Go, an enthusiasm for testing (we use BDD and TDD), hands-on experience with cryptographic protocols, and a pretty good comprehension of how the web works. Bonus points if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re familiar with testing smart contracts or web3.js. \n\nThe ideal person for this job is experienced, self-motivated, reliable and trying to the best all-round person they can be. Aside from that, experience with cryptocurrency, large-scale economics or financial services applications would be extremely advantageous. \n\n## Skills & requirements\nWe're a small group of people who value self improvement, honesty, humility and curiosity tempered with a healthy skepticism. We like people who do everything to the best of their ability, but accept their limits. The problems we're trying to solve can be tough, and no one person has all the answers. But we're excited to try and find solutions, and you should be too. \n\nIn terms of technical stuff, we require: \n\n- A minimum of one year's experience with Go, especially in reference to Ethereum. We only ship clean, well-tested, interface-first code. \n- Great communication. We're a distributed team, but we're also a lean startup. \n- Experience working remotely. It takes discipline and grit. \n- Some understanding of BDD, or at least TDD. We consider test coverage to be an integral part of good production code, and you should too. \n- A good understanding of Git. We love Git Flow like it's our own child. \n- Some familiarity with the terminal. We use Docker, as well as standard tooling like Makefiles and shell scripts.\n\nIt would also be super if you: \n\n- Have experience with crypto startups, ICOs, and the like. \n- Have spent a couple of years working with web technologies. A good grasp of HTTP, REST, RPC (ideally gRPC) would be highly advantageous. \n- Really enjoy refactoring.\n- Have tinkered with k8s.\n- Consider documentation to be as important as code. \n- Have any background in philosophy or economics. \n- Administer Linux boxes for fun and profit. \n- Have a deep and abiding love for vim or neovim. There may be a fight if you fall on the Emacs (ie. wrong) side of the tracks. \n- Think tmux is just super. \n",
